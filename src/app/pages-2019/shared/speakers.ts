        Much Stuff (Delbert McClinton).</p>

      <p>What can we do when a home is to be staged but it has too much stuff? Adding 
        organizing to your instrument case would create an additional income stream and help 
        you to raise the bar for your business. You can increase the coloratura of your 
        staging, bring forte to your services and shift the tenor of your offerings.</p>

      <p>This presentation will allow you to make an overture to your clients to help them get 
        their stuff together before you stage the home. After this presentation you will be 
        able to provide organizing as a prelude to Home Staging.</p>

      <p>When Stuff (Third Eye Blind) gets in the way of Home Staging you can be Hot Stuff 
        (Ashlee Simpson) and add organizing to your orchestra. You can end up Lovin Stuff 
        (Muddy Waters) as your opportunities increase to make more Money, Money, Money 
        (ABBA).</p>

        back burner.  They make their clients the priority… understandable… but in the process,

      <p>A stager’s business has to be in ‘tune’ so that doesn’t happen! I’m on a mission to
