      <p>There’s Good Stuff (B52’s), Old Stuff (Garth Brooks), The Right Stuff (Bryan Ferry), 
        Stuff (Miles Davis), Ruff Stuff (AC/DC), Busted Stuff (Dave Matthews Band) and Too 
        Much Stuff (Delbert McClinton).</p>

      <p>What can we do when a home is to be staged but it has too much stuff? Adding 
        organizing to your instrument case would create an additional income stream and help 
        you to raise the bar for your business. You can increase the coloratura of your 
        staging, bring forte to your services and shift the tenor of your offerings.</p>

      <p>This presentation will allow you to make an overture to your clients to help them get 
        their stuff together before you stage the home. After this presentation you will be 
        able to provide organizing as a prelude to Home Staging.</p>

      <p>When Stuff (Third Eye Blind) gets in the way of Home Staging you can be Hot Stuff 
        (Ashlee Simpson) and add organizing to your orchestra. You can end up Lovin Stuff 
        (Muddy Waters) as your opportunities increase to make more Money, Money, Money 
        (ABBA).</p>

      <p>Upgrade your business, IN and OUT, so you save time, money and effort… and make more!  
        Staging business owners are often so busy working ON the part of the business they love, 
        ‘doing the staging’, that they easily put what’s happening IN their business, on the 
        back burner.  They make their clients the priority… understandable… but in the process, 
        the profitability of their business gets ignored.</p>

      <p>A stager’s business has to be in ‘tune’ so that doesn’t happen! I’m on a mission to 
        help stagers strike the right balance so the effort they’re putting into their staging 
        projects is matched by the profit they earn! No successful stager should be compromising 
        on profit money.</p>

      <p>Identify FIVE questions on what is causing your business to be less profitable than 
        it should be - and then learn the ANSWERS so your business is in ‘tune,’ and profitable.  
        Your award-winning staging is about to be matched only by your outstanding profits – 
        you are about to have the business you deserve!</p>
