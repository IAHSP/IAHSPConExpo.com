			<p><strong>A Journey of Pivots Unlike Any Other</strong></p>
			
			<p>Ravi is an international keynote speaker who empowers education and business leaders to pivot for success in multi-cultural and multigenerational 
			environments. Born into a lineage of prime ministers and raised by a family of Wall Street bankers, his journey as a rock star, aviator, and cultural 
			diplomat for the US Dept. of State is an inspiring example of how to stay relevant in an ever-changing world.</p>
			
			<p>The first American-born member of the family that created and governed the world's largest democracy for over 40 years, Ravi is the grand-nephew of 
			Jawaharlal Nehru (India's first prime minister) and the cousin of prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
			
			<p>He became an artist-entrepreneur before graduating high school, but Ravi's worldwide visibility skyrocketed in 1997 as the guitarist for triple Grammy 
			nominee, Hanson. Their massive millennial fanbase catapulted them to the White House, Madison Square Garden, Saturday Night Live, and more. He continued 
			performing and began giving artist-entrepreneurship keynotes sponsored by the music products industry.</p>
			
			<p>In 2008, Ravi became a pilot and aviation manufacturers sponsored his keynotes on millennials to help reverse the shrinking pilot population.</p>
			
			<p>In 2015, the US Dept. of State began sponsoring his keynotes and cultural programs in Russia, Indonesia, Iraq, and Lebanon. He also founded Ravi Unites 
			Schools—a large network of international K-12 schools whose classes participate in peer-to-peer real-time audio-video interactions hosted by Ravi. He 
			believes that these opportunities create a path to world peace.</p>
			
			<p>While Ravi has been speaking at conferences, businesses, and educational institutions since 1999, it became his primary focus in 2015. Having already 
			published a memoir (Simon & Schuster) and hundreds of magazine articles, the global pandemic of 2020 created the space for Ravi to complete his highly 
			anticipated book, <em>PIVOT: Empowering Students Today to Succeed in an Unpredictable Tomorrow</em>.</p>
