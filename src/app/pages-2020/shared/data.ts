			<p><strong>A Journey of Pivots Unlike Any Other</strong></p>
			
			<p>Ravi is an international keynote speaker who empowers education and business leaders to pivot for success in multi-cultural and multigenerational 
			environments. Born into a lineage of prime ministers and raised by a family of Wall Street bankers, his journey as a rock star, aviator, and cultural 
			diplomat for the US Dept. of State is an inspiring example of how to stay relevant in an ever-changing world.</p>
			
			<p>The first American-born member of the family that created and governed the world's largest democracy for over 40 years, Ravi is the grand-nephew of 
			Jawaharlal Nehru (India's first prime minister) and the cousin of prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
			
			<p>He became an artist-entrepreneur before graduating high school, but Ravi's worldwide visibility skyrocketed in 1997 as the guitarist for triple Grammy 
			nominee, Hanson. Their massive millennial fanbase catapulted them to the White House, Madison Square Garden, Saturday Night Live, and more. He continued 
			performing and began giving artist-entrepreneurship keynotes sponsored by the music products industry.</p>
			
			<p>In 2008, Ravi became a pilot and aviation manufacturers sponsored his keynotes on millennials to help reverse the shrinking pilot population.</p>
			
			<p>In 2015, the US Dept. of State began sponsoring his keynotes and cultural programs in Russia, Indonesia, Iraq, and Lebanon. He also founded Ravi Unites 
			Schools—a large network of international K-12 schools whose classes participate in peer-to-peer real-time audio-video interactions hosted by Ravi. He 
			believes that these opportunities create a path to world peace.</p>
			
			<p>While Ravi has been speaking at conferences, businesses, and educational institutions since 1999, it became his primary focus in 2015. Having already 
			published a memoir (Simon & Schuster) and hundreds of magazine articles, the global pandemic of 2020 created the space for Ravi to complete his highly 
			anticipated book, <em>PIVOT: Empowering Students Today to Succeed in an Unpredictable Tomorrow</em>.</p>

			<p>The LIVE Broadcast Network. TheLBN is the first LIVE stream broadcast network to host original programs with a variety of topics, niches and genres, 
			regularly scheduled with celebrity hosts and guests, exclusively on social media.</p>

			<p>Instead of going LIVE multiple times per week, Joseph signing new hosts and show concepts under multiple categories, such as; food, travel, music, 
			design, lifestyle and more.  Each show features its own host, theme, guests, branding and network reach. Though it will all broadcast from The LIVE Broadcast 
			Network business page, as a media and broadcasting network.</p>
			
			<p>When asked about this, Joseph said, "This has been done before in television and radio. Before networks were established, individuals were broadcasting 
			on the free airwaves. Then networks like ABC and NBC formed, to pool talent and sell advertisement. We are employing the same business model through social 
			media."  By operating as a network, TheLBN is able to offer advertisement as both a network and show sponsorship. This allows companies to either benefit 
			from a broad market segment reach. Or drill directly into the viewership within a specific show's niche audience.</p>
			
			<p>What started as a rant, has the potential to change the concept of influencer marketing in an over saturated social media famous landscape. As consumers 
			migrate away from cable television to mobile platforms, such as Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. The LIVE Broadcast Network business model may set the precedence 
			for a viable LIVE stream media broadcasting alternative.</p>
			
			<p>Joseph says that he is looking to capture Facebook's attention by proving that this is a viable avenue that would give Facebook a competitive advantage 
			over other media outlets. The LIVE Broadcast Network already has several Hollywood celebrities in the pipeline for weekly LIVE broadcasts that are monetized 
			and provide compensation that rivals most established networks budgets. For sponsors, The LIVE Broadcast Network offers unparalleled engagement and digital 
			interactive capability. The future of television may just become LIVE stream network broadcasting on Facebook. And The LIVE Broadcast Network is the first 
			to market in this new frontier.</p>

			<p>Founder and Education Director of DIY Education at How to Decorate and Stage, Creator & Instructor at Confident Color System and Founder at The Decorating 
			and Staging Academy</p>

			<p>I LOVE HOUSES!  Creating beautiful spaces is in my DNA.  My Dad was a contractor,  and my Mother was always turning a sow’s ear into a silk purse.  Money 
			(or the lack of it) never stopped her from making her home the best it could be. I caught their bug for transformation and as soon as I had enough muscle 
			power, I was pushing furniture around.  In fact, just moments before I sat down to write this copy, I was rearranging my family room.  It still is a great 
			stress reliever.</p>
			
			<p>My early adult years were spent using my various apartments and homes as a decorating lab.  My first Husband often arrived home to see I had moved the 
			dining room into the living room, painted something crazy, (there was even a red toilet attempt, which resulted in a finish that stuck to his bottom more 
			than the toilet) Did I mention he was my first Husband…bless the poor man…he was there during my formative years.   Over the years, I did everything I 
			could to get into homes. I began with a wallpapering and painting business and earned my Real Estate license which allowed me access to any house I 
			wanted to see.</p>
			
			<p>Let me be honest…houses were my jam.</p>
			
			<p>So where did all this passion take me?  Well, it has now been 45 years…and I am still doing what I love.  Even better, I get to teach others how to do 
			what I do.  Over the past 20 years, I have won many awards, added education to my mix, appeared multiple times on HGTV and ABC, was featured in many 
			publications, did unique projects in Dubai, Turkey, and Nigeria, and have taught thousands how to create beautiful rooms.</p>
			
			<p>Plus, I am the Mom of 3 amazing grown kids, step-mother to 2, and a very hands-on Grandma to 16, ranging in age from 4-24. Bonus-my first Great 
			Grandchild, Hayden, was recently born.</p>
